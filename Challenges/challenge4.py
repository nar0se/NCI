# Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. 
# Create an application that prompts the user for the length, width, and height of a rectangular room. 
# Pass these three values to a function that does the following:
#   - Calculates the wall area for a room.
#   - Passes the calculated wall area to another method that calculates and returns the number of gallons of paint needed.
#   - Displays the number of gallons needed.
#   - Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon, assuming that the painter can buy any fraction of a gallon of paint 
#     at the same price as a whole gallon.
#   - Returns the price
# â€‹
# The final price is displayed. For example, the cost to paint a 15-by-20-foot room with 10-foot ceilings is $64. 
# Save the application as paintcalculator.py

# 350 = 20 * 17.5
